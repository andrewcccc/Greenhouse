# Greenhouse
ECE UAlberta Capstone project (2020 September - 2021 May)

The capstone project was about the development of a mini smart greenhouse. The goal was to optimize plant growth conditions and energy consumption using humidity, temperature and current sensors, a camera module, and a smartphone.

I designed and developed an Android mobile application to retrieve our sensor data and mushroom images for monitoring the conditions of our mushrooms in the greenhouse.

The app was built in Andorid Studio programming in Java.

Hightlights: 
* Used Retrofit API to retrieve JSON sensor data
* Used MPAndroidChart librsry to retrieve graphical data
* Used Picasso library to retrieve image results
