# Greenhouse
ECE UAlberta Capstone project (2020 September - 2021 May)

The capstone project was about the development of a mini smart greenhouse. The goal was to optimize plant growth conditions and energy consumption using sensors, a camera module, and a smartphone.

I was responsible to design and develop an Android mobile application to retrieve our sensor data and mushroom images for monitoring the conditions of our mushrooms in the greenhouse.
